**FFF Analysis - AERB:**

1. **RFA Data**
   - Measure beam profiles with the following settings:
     - Field Size: 20 cm x 20 cm
     - Depth: 10 cm
     - Source-to-Surface Distance (SSD): 90 cm.
   - Normalize your beam profile to 100%, then export the data to an Excel file.
   - Ensure the Excel file includes two sheets:
     - **Inline Sheet**: Columns should be labeled "Inline (cm)" and "Dose (%)".
     - **Crossline Sheet**: Columns should be labeled "Crossline (cm)" and "Dose (%)".
   - Record energy and depth information in the file.

2. **2D Image Data**
   - Upload an EPID image (.dcm or .tiff) for a 20 cm x 20 cm field.
   - Place a 10 cm slab phantom at an SSD of 90 cm and expose.
   - Enter energy and depth information accordingly.

**Winston-Lutz QA:**

1. Prepare a folder with .dcm files.
2. Follow these examples for valid file naming conventions:
   - Examples of valid names:
     - `MyWL-gantry0-coll90-couch315.dcm`
     - `gantry90_stuff_coll45-couch0.dcm`
     - `abc-couch45-gantry315-coll0.dcm`
     - `01-gantry0-abcd-coll30couch10abc.dcm`
     - `abc-gantry30.dcm`
     - `coll45abc.dcm`
   - Examples of invalid names:
     - `mywl-gantry=0-coll=90-couch=315.dcm`
     - `gan45_collimator30-table270.dcm`
3. Specify the ball bearing size in millimeters.

**Picket Fence:**

1. Upload a .dcm or .tiff file.
2. Enter the desired tolerance and action level.
3. To analyze individual leaves:
   - Select the "Separate Leaves" option.
4. For combined leaf analysis:
   - Deselect the "Separate Leaves" option.
5. Define the nominal gap for analysis:
   - Enter the expected picket gap in millimeters.
   - This value is only necessary for separate leaf analysis.
   - Due to DLG and EPID scattering, the appropriate gap may require user adjustment.
